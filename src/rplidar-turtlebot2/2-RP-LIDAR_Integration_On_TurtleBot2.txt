Proceed with rp lidar setup (see 1-RP-LIDAR_Setup_HowTo.txt)

download catkin packages on THE NAS FOLDER //roboticsprojects/Documentation/RP-LiDAR/turtlebot_le2i
compile them

to test that your lidar integration on TB2 is OK do the following :

	on the TB2 netbook:
	roslaunch turtlebot_le2i rplidar_minimal.launch
	(instead of roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch)

	on the workstation:
	roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch

	activate the /scan topic to chek if the lidar data is correctly captured and displayed
