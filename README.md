# ROS-Project
Repository for Robotics Project Module on ROS platform and TurtleBot 2

Implementing a set of computer vision and autonomous navigation algorithms using TutleBot 2 with ROS Hydro. LiDAR is used for mapping and AMCL approach to localize the robot in a map. Microsoft Kinect is used for capturing visual and depth information. Computer vision tasks such as AR-tag detection and localization, face detection and recognition has been realized alongside using SMACH framework for concurrency, initial pose estimation of the robot was also done using visual information obtained from AR-tags. Python was used as the main programming language with a set of open-source packages such as: OpenCV, rplidar, rbx1 and rbx2.
